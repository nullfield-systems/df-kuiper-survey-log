## Overview

EISA-04-KUIPER was deployed under contract by **Nullfield Systems** to survey relativistic anomalies within the gravitational envelope of Sagittarius A*. The probe operated autonomously using the Cortex-A3 Observation Stack.

On **2041.07.29**, transmission logs captured visual and non-spectral data consistent with **extrastellar geometric anomalies**. Shortly after detection of **Object 41-Θ-Σ**, telemetry integrity degraded, and time signature reversal occurred.

All vectors remain unanchored.
