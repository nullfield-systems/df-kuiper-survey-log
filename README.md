# df-kuiper-survey-log

 **Unit 04-KUIPER** **Telemetry Mirror Archive | Log Date: 2041.07.29** **Extended Interface Survey Array (EISA)**

 > _Contractor: Cortex Astrionics_ _Governing Entity: Nullfield Systems_ 

 ## Summary

 **Nullfield Systems** contracted to launch EISA-04-KUIPER to survey anomalies within the Sagittarius A* envelope.  The Cortex-A3 Observation Stack was used by the probe to function independently.

 Transmission logs from **2041.07.29** showed non-spectral and visual data that was consistent with **extrastellar geometric anomalies**.  Telemetry integrity deteriorated and the time signature reversed shortly after **Object 41-Θ-Σ** was detected.
